## Week 1

Submit a PDF of the following questions, answered in 4-5 lines. Although, there is no minimum or maximum limit. <b>There is NO grading</b>, So do not complete it for the sake of completing it. Plagarism is unacceptable. If you believe you cannot answer a question: Google it, and answer to the best of your understanding.

1. What is the Blockchain?
2. What is the difference between a decentralized and distributed system?
3. What are the advantages a Blockchain Application would have over a centralized System?
4. If you had to develop one out of these four internet services: Amazon, Twitter, WhatsApp and Spotify, which one would you develop as a decentralized application, and why?
5. How does a payemnt from Bitcoin differ from a UPI (gPay, BHIM, PayTM) payment?

<b>Extra Task</b><br>
Review <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhUjJmGguY0">Episode 8, S5 of Silicon Valley<a> (That video is not complete, you can find a part 2 of it <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8W7xhN2ue8">here</a>). Analyze what's happening, what is the 51% attack they talked about and how did they solve it?
  
## Submission Guidelines

PLease submit your PDF on the group, or personally if you're uncomfortable. Though I will suggest putting it in the group, so that we can have open discussions.

## Week 2

This week is all about learning Solidity. I got started with Gregory from dAppUniversity. Go through his <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbbtODcOYIoE0D6fschNU4rqtGFRpk3ea">playlist</a> once (obviously skipping some stuff). We will also make use of two super cool websites: Coursera and PluralSight. If you don't like video format, Solidity has a pretty good documentation.

**Task**
1. Write a Smart Contract in Solidity for a ToDo list (Title, Task, Deadline) and deploy it on any Blockchain (Ganache/Remix).
2. Make an account on Pluralsight and use that to complete 3-4 courses on Blockchain (suggested below), it is ONLY free for this month.*
3. Go to <a href="https://faucet.metamask.io/">Ropsten Eth Faucet</a> after installing Metamask and get 1 Eth. Then transact 0.2 Eth (These are not real Ethereum) to my account (0xFb1c5cF9216b1cB431A24072a3CA4Cf4056fa3E0) using Metamask. Use this Ropsten Ethereum to deploy your Smart Contract on the Ropsten Chain.<br>

(* Optional)<br>

**Submission Guideline**<br>
Submit via GitHub to a repo and send repo link in Group. If you manage to push code to Ropsten, I will test it from my device.
